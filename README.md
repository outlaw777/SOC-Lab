**Objective:** 
To configure an effective and efficient Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to enhance the security posture of the network infrastructure.

 
   - Identify all network assets including servers, workstations, routers, switches, and other network devices.
   - Categorize assets based on their criticality and importance to the organization's operations. 
   - Evaluate available IDS solutions based on factors such as features, scalability, ease of integration, and compatibility with existing network infrastructure.
   - Select an IDS solution that best fits the organization's requirements and budget.
   - Determine strategic locations for placing IDS sensors within the network architecture.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage of network segments to detect intrusions effectively.
   - Define detection rules based on known attack signatures, abnormal behavior patterns, and traffic anomalies.
   - Fine-tune detection rules to minimize false positives and negatives while maximizing detection accuracy.
   - Integrate IDS with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems for centralized log collection, correlation, and analysis.
   - Ensure seamless integration with existing log management infrastructure to facilitate incident response and forensic investigations.
   - Develop incident response procedures for handling alerts generated by the IDS.
   - Define escalation paths, roles, and responsibilities of personnel involved in the incident response process.
