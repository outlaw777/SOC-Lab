# SOC-Lab

## Objective

To configure an effective and efficient Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to enhance the security posture of the network infrastructure.



### Skills Learned

   - Identify all network assets including servers, workstations, routers, switches, and other network devices.
   - Determine strategic locations for placing IDS sensors within the network architecture.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage of network segments to detect intrusions effectively.
   - Define detection rules based on known attack signatures, abnormal behavior patterns, and traffic anomalies.
   - Fine-tune detection rules to minimize false positives and negatives while maximizing detection accuracy.
   - Integrate IDS with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems for centralized log collection, correlation, and analysis
   - Used a packet crafter to sumulate a DOS attack on two virtual machines in a control environment.




### Tools Used


- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
